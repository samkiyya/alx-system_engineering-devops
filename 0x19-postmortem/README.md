# Issue Summary

**Duration of the Outage:**  
The outage lasted from 3:45 PM to 6:15 PM UTC on August 14, 2024.

**Impact:**  
Our e-commerce platform, which handles over 20,000 concurrent users during peak hours, experienced a complete service outage. Customers were unable to browse products, add items to their carts, or complete transactions. Approximately 95% of active users were affected, resulting in an estimated loss of $150,000 in potential revenue and numerous customer complaints on social media.

**Root Cause:**  
The root cause was a misconfigured database replication setup that led to data inconsistencies, causing the application to fail when attempting to read from the corrupted data sources.

# Timeline

- **3:45 PM** - The issue was detected when the monitoring system triggered multiple alerts indicating a sharp increase in error rates across the platform.
- **3:50 PM** - The on-call engineer received a pager notification and immediately began investigating the issue, starting with the application logs.
- **4:00 PM** - The engineer identified that all database read requests were returning errors, indicating a possible issue with the database servers.
- **4:10 PM** - The database team was notified and began inspecting the primary database and its replicas.
- **4:25 PM** - A misleading assumption was made that the issue was due to a sudden spike in traffic, leading to an attempt to scale the application servers horizontally. However, this did not resolve the issue.
- **4:45 PM** - The database team discovered that one of the database replicas was out of sync due to a misconfiguration during the latest deployment, causing data corruption.
- **5:00 PM** - The incident was escalated to the senior engineering team, and the decision was made to take the affected replica offline.
- **5:15 PM** - The database was restored from a backup taken earlier in the day, and the corrupted data was removed from the system.
- **6:00 PM** - The application was gradually brought back online, and user traffic was carefully monitored to ensure stability.
- **6:15 PM** - Full service was restored, and the platform was fully operational.

# Root Cause and Resolution

**Root Cause:**  
The root cause of the outage was a misconfiguration in the database replication setup that occurred during a routine maintenance operation earlier in the day. The replication process was configured to sync data with an outdated schema, which led to data corruption when read requests were made to the replica. This caused the application to throw errors and eventually crash as it attempted to process the inconsistent data.

**Resolution:**  
The immediate resolution involved taking the corrupted database replica offline to prevent further damage and restoring the database from a backup taken before the maintenance operation. The replication setup was then reconfigured to ensure that all replicas were correctly synced with the updated schema. The application was brought back online in stages to ensure that it could handle the incoming traffic without further issues.

# Corrective and Preventative Measures

**Improvements:**

- Implement a more rigorous validation process for database schema changes, ensuring that all replicas are correctly synced before going live.
- Enhance monitoring to detect data inconsistencies in real-time, allowing for quicker identification and resolution of similar issues.
- Conduct regular disaster recovery drills to ensure that the team is well-prepared to handle such incidents in the future.

**Tasks:**

1. Reconfigure the database replication setup and conduct a full audit to ensure consistency across all replicas.
2. Develop and deploy automated tests to check for data consistency across replicas before and after any schema changes.
3. Update the incident response plan to include steps for verifying database integrity during outages.
4. Schedule a post-incident review meeting to discuss the root cause, the resolution process, and ways to improve future responses.

# Conclusion

This outage underscored the importance of thorough validation and testing during routine maintenance operations, especially when dealing with critical systems like databases. The corrective and preventative measures outlined above will help mitigate the risk of similar incidents in the future, ensuring that our platform remains reliable and resilient under pressure.
